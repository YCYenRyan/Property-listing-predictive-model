This is one of my personal projects: scraping property listings off of a website and building a predictive model to determine the value of a property.

This repository contains KL-property-listings.ipynb, a jupyter notebook file containing the code and steps taken to create the predictive model, and two datasets: combinedataframe(the pre-processed dataset of data scraped online) and processedcombinedataframe(the post-processed dataset). Processes like data cleaning, data manipulation, data analysis and model building are all detailed in KL-property-listings.ipynb
